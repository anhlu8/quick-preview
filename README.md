Shopify App:

I developed a Node.js + Express application that connects to Shopify. My application will authenticate with a shop & help eCommerce shop owners on Shopify automate their business operations by adding features & functionalities to their online stores. This app specifically will let customers view a product's images without being redicted to another page.

Technologies used:
ngrok (to create a public HTTPS address)
Javascript
Node.js
Express
Restful APIs
Requestjs
Noncejs
